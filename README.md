<!-- #### Notice: If you like this project, please consider [donating](https://github.com/matronator#support). The battery on my macbook died and I need to get it replaced to be able to work, but a battery replacement for a 7 year old macbook is kinda expensive and money's little tight right now. Any help would be much appretiated! Thank you :) -->
